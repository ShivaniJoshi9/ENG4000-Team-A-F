 The team utilized my strengths of diving deep, and delivering results. I was able dive deep into the components of the Bag Mask Valve(BMV), by doing research as task. Thereafter, deliver the results in the form of a comprehensive research document ****[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fbR2aad2eUqU_aILc2vjHCjWiD7Ffg1f/view?usp=sharing)****. A weakness that I identified during our team's sprints was communicating effectively. I worked improving this through collaboration with peers, and by being to-the-point with my communication. In essence, this helped our team save time, and allowed us to address multiple touch-points instead of running out of time.  

* [ ] Jonathan Blumenfeld \
My strength is being able to listen and understand different people's perspectives, and the team itlizied it by allowing me play the role of the scrum master; using the collective wisdom of the group to plan our scrum meetings and make decisions. One area where I could improve on is being too agreeable.  I will try to make my own opinions heard moving forward rather than agreeing for the sake of avoiding conflict.
