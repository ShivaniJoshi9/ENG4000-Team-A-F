# Product Vision 

### Main idea: A process to maintain blood oxygenation levels in a patient while in transport.

### Purpose for Creating the Product
* ***How the project/product aligns with the team's purpose, interests, capabilities?*** 

It aligns with the team’s purpose to develop sustainable solutions relating to environmental
and humanitarian causes. In trying to tackle this issue, our team will be able to showcase
their expertise while being fueled by our collective passions and motivation.

* ***In essence the purpose of creating this product is,***

Currently, there exist manual ventilating systems that may be administered by paramedics or
relatives accompanying patients to maintain blood oxygenation levels; while being
transported from semi-rural locations lacking appropriate medical facilities, to the ones
equipped with vacant ICUs on an ambulance; after suffering from mild hypoxia stemming
from breathing difficulties. A recent research done by the NCBI (in the U.S.A) concluded that
the rate of equipment-related mishaps may be as high as one-third of all transports[4]. 

We as a team would like to create a product that will aid in giving travelling patients a better
chance at surviving these journeys even in the absence of assistive medical personnel on
board. Developing an automated version of the pre-existing and readily available manual
ventilating system, along with added assistive features can potentially be an exceptional
solution. This approach was derived by extensive communication with stakeholders.

### Target Group

* ***For various target customers and/or users for the product/project, who are they and are they a subset of a larger societal Segment?***

Our target group consists of communities in the state of Gujarat, India. Gujarat is a diverse
state that has a good blend of rural, urban and semi-urban communities. Gujarat has a lot of
smaller medical facilities within close vicinity of larger highly equipped medical
establishments.This proximity can be leveraged to ensure our proposed solution is
functionally sound for shorter travel times(approx 1 to 2 hours). In addition to the
aforementioned, the majority of the stakeholders practice medicine in or or hail from the
state.

### Problem solved by the Product

* ***What is the groups articulation of the problem the product/project will address?***

Often times, smaller medical centres find themselves understaffed and lacking
sophisticated technologies. As a result patients coming-in with blood-oxygen saturation
levels under or close to 90%, on experiencing different levels of hypoxia (which could be
caused by various lung infections, breathing disorders, unconsciousness or trauma) need
to be transferred to locations that have intensive care units.

Normally, under such circumstances, the patient is intubated and the endotracheal tube is
connected to an ambulated manual breathing unit (AMBU). This is connected to a
pressurized oxygen tank, and a blood oximeter (attached to the patient's finger), which
measure the oxygen saturation and pulse rates respectively. The AMBU bag needs to be
manually pumped at a rate of 12-16 breaths/minute to maintain healthy blood-oxygen
saturation level until they can be shifted to an assistive ventilator[2]. 

Moreover, due to uneven terrain, bad weather conditions or other reasons the ambulance
could jolt which could lead to loose connectivity between different components thereby
destabilizing the patient. According to the US national library of medicine in around 125
transports of ventilated and non ventilated patients reported, 34% of cases were related to
disconnection of various equipment[4]. 

Tackling multiple problems simultaneously could fatigue and exhaust the administrator,
making them prone to mistakes. Furthermore, trained paramedics may not be available to
accompany the patient in the ambulance, which may force untrained relatives of the patient
to take on the responsibility of manually pumping the AMBU.

Considering the aforementioned challenges, our proposed solution can help free up
paramedics and prevent scenarios where untrained relatives have vast responsibilities thrust
upon them.

### Product description, uniqueness, feasibility

* ***What will the product/project do to address that problem (not how), and how does this differ from what any existing product/projects do?***

Unifying these scenarios and extensive discussions with stakeholders, we propose possible
avenues for optimizing the AMBU bag. Firstly, we wish to automate the manual pumping
mechanism such that the pump rate is maintained without the need of constant human
supervision. Secondly, we aim to equip this automated AMBU bag with alarms that signify
oxygen leakage, assisting trained/untrained help in identifying the source.

As mentioned previously, the existing product is manually operated and no provision for
technology that assists in discovering the leakage origins exist currently.

### Product Societal Benefits

* ***What are the broader benefits from such a product/project? (multi-bottom-line)***

We created this ***[video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lDpf2OwH8vQv18Z0P44cy0IMcYMbR019/view?usp=sharing)***, to answer the above question.
