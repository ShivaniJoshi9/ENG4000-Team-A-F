Most teams make projects at the beginning of each sprint and track their work through each stage to make sure they know where their sprint work stands.

We’ve provided some example content in this template to get you started, but you should add tasks, change task names, add more Custom Fields, and change any other info to make this project your own.  When you’re ready to begin work, you can complete this task, or keep it in your project for easy access to our tips below.
