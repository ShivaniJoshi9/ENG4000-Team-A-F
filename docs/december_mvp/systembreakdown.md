<h1>Sprint Process -Team AF</h1>

Our Sprint Process included both long term and short term planning.  

The long term planning included deciding on the narrative for each of our two week sprints.  
These narratives encapsulated the primary goals of each sprint, which would move us forward to our minimum viable product, and eventually our final product.  These narratives were elected by our product owner, and validated by the group members.  

The “short term” planning consisted of two week sprints, which included seven meetings taking place on Mondays (x2) Wednesdays (x2) and Fridays (x2), and Sundays (x1).  

We had four types of meetings:

<h2>1. Sprint planning session </h2>
Before the meeting our product owner (Shivani) would populate the backlog with deliverables which would help the group fulfill the goal of our sprint narrative. These would be assigned story points according to the expected amount of time they would take to complete.  Before the meeting the product owner and the scrum master (Jonathan) would meet to refine the backlog.   During the meeting, these deliverables and their storypoint values would be adjusted democratically, and would be delegated to group members by the scrum master (Jonathan). The deliverables were delegated according to the skillset and availability of group members that week.  By the end of each sprint planning session, group members would depart with a strong sense of their sprint objectives/deliverables. 

<h2>2. Standup</h2>

As we progressed the sprint process, our scrum master made a few adjustments with each iteration.  Namely, making the standups more discussion based, so that the group members would have a chance to question members while they did their standups.  This allowed group members to deliver feedback and suggestions to each other.  

<h2>3.  Meeting with project supervisor</h2>
The team would meet with Dr. Franz Newland, who would ensure our group was staying on track, and advise group members on how to achieve tasks.  These meetings consisted of updating Dr. Newland on our progress, and asking for advice on completing deliverables and improving our sprint planning. 

<h2>4. Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective</h2>
This meeting would consist of a 30 minute sprint review which would aim to go over what we had achieved in our previous sprint, followed by a 30 minute retrospective in which we would go over how we could make each sprint iteration as optimal as possible.  

For the review, group members would update the other group members with what tasks they had accomplished that week, including the key takeaways for the rest of the group members. 
These reviews helped the scrum master determine how to run sprints more effectively.  For example, when group members were struggling to complete their tasks, it gave the scrum master an understanding of how to better incorporate workload into the delegation equation.  When a member   (Ie. how to allocate deliverables, populate backlog, manage workload, etc.  
 

For the retrospective, group members would populate a Stormboard (seen below) attached to our team AF Microsoft Teams channel.  This exercise would allow group members to discuss positive and negative aspects of the running of each sprint. We would conclude with a discussion on how we could improve our sprints.  These discussions were crucial for the product owner and scrum master to improve the sprints.  For example, in the storm board below, one member mentioned they wanted less “meetings lasting beyond the scheduled time”, since the members had meetings scheduled after some of the standups.  In response, the scrum master started creating schedules for each meeting, and made itineraries for each meeting according to what was the most urgent and essential.
