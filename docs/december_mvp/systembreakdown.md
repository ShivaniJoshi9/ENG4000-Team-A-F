<h1>Sprint Process -Team AF</h1>

Our Sprint Process included both long term and short term planning.  

The long term planning included deciding on the narrative for each of our two week sprints.  
These narratives encapsulated the primary goals of each sprint, which would move us forward to our minimum viable product, and eventually our final product.  These narratives were elected by our product owner, and validated by the group members.  

The “short term” planning consisted of two week sprints, which included seven meetings taking place on Mondays (x2) Wednesdays (x2) and Fridays (x2), and Sundays (x1).  

We had four types of meetings:

<h2>1. Sprint planning session </h2>
Before the meeting our product owner (Shivani) would populate the backlog with deliverables which would help the group fulfill the goal of our sprint narrative. These would be assigned story points according to the expected amount of time they would take to complete.  Before the meeting the product owner and the scrum master (Jonathan) would meet to refine the backlog.   During the meeting, these deliverables and their storypoint values would be adjusted democratically, and would be delegated to group members by the scrum master (Jonathan). The deliverables were delegated according to the skillset and availability of group members that week.  By the end of each sprint planning session, group members would depart with a strong sense of their sprint objectives/deliverables.
