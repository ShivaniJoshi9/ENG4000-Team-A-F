Our SWOT analysis showcases how the strengths mitigate the weaknesses mentioned above in the table. In evaluating our weaknesses we came up with effective solutions using each of our team member’s strengths as a whole. 

For instance, due to the lack of the medical knowledge we researched in a systematic manner such that we learnt how agile works as well as could access the medical aspects with the help of great stakeholders. 

Secondly, instead of waiting on late shipment or blaming the faulty hardware, we got extra parts beforehand to not waste time as well as figured out other resources of how to get those parts such as an acquaintance, guidance from Dr Franz(our supervisor) as to how to wire it correctly such that there is no short circuit or any impending issues with the circuitry such that the product isn't damaged.

Thirdly,getting in touch with stakeholders was difficult due to the different time zone but the team managed to do the research beforehand and keep the questions ready such that we would not waste anyone’s precious time and ask for timely feedback.

Furthermore, because of the organized sprint planning the team accounted for certain slip days keeping certain scenarios in mind such as cancelling a meeting or not being able to work due to any reason.To add on, the team had a high overhead to for research and explore different avenues but it was a smooth transition as we all learnt each other’s strengths and divided work in that manner.

To conclude, we have taken all the negative risks into account by using positive risk approaches as mentioned in the examples above.
