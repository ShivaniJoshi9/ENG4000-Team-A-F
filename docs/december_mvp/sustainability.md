<h1>Sustainability Impact And Negative Consequences Of MVP Design</h1>
<b> 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere </b>

Negative impact: There is a possibility that hospitals can decide to increase the prices for ambulances that will be equipped with automated pumping mechanisms. Although there should only be the initial purchase made for integrating our product into the ambulances. And maintenance cost would be extremely minimal. This is a possible associate consequence of integrating our product into ambulances. Increase in the price of the ambulance will have an impact on people who are less fortunate.

<b> 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all age </b>
<ul>
Positive impact: 
We are decreasing the amount of work that medical professionals(ward boy) have to do while in transit. They will no longer be required to sit and bag a patient, they can now focus on other procedures while being at ease that the manual pumping has been taken care of. This will ensure the well being of patients of all ages as the medical professional will not be preoccupied and will now be less prone to errors. 
</ul>

9.Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Positive impact: 
We are considering making our product  open source and diverse while being cheap. It will be available for anyone to modify and use on their own. We are expecting people to add on to our work and implement it to their liking.  


12.Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
Positive Impact:
Lowering carbon footprint.  One goal we did achieve was building our MVP prototype out of reused components.  With a few exceptions all of the components were borrowed. 
For example, we repurposed a broken 3D printer, we used the mechanism that moves that ink cartage to pump our ambu bag. We used the wires from old machines we were going to discard.  Moving forward We plan on continuing to be resourceful for our alpha release. This also allowed us to spend within our means.


13.Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts*
Positive Impact:
Lowering the carbon footprint by attempting to use old materials. Our product does not create any carbon dioxide or green houses in the future. Our current plan is also to have our product work via a  rechargeable power source.
