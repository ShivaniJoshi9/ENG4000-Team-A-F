<h1>Sustainability Impact And Negative Consequences Of MVP Design</h1>
<b> Sustainability goal #1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere </b>      
<ul>
Negative impact: There is a possibility that hospitals can decide to increase the prices for ambulances that will be equipped with automated BVMs even though there should only be the initial purchase made for integrating our product into the ambulances, and maintenance cost would be extremely minimal. This is a possible associated consequence of integrating our product into ambulances. Increase in the price of the ambulance will have an impact on people who are less financially secure.
</ul>
<b> Sustainability goal #3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all age </b>
<ul>
Positive impact: 
We are decreasing the amount of work that medical professionals have to do while in transit by ambulance. They will no longer be required to sit and manually ventilate patients, and can now focus on other procedures knowing that the manual pumping has been taken care of. This will ensure the well being of patients of all ages as the medical professional will not be preoccupied and will now be less prone to errors. 
</ul>

<b>Sustainability goal #9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation</b>
<ul>
Positive impact: 
We are considering making our product  open source and customizable.  Because it is quite affordable, it will be widely accessible for anyone to modify and customize. We are expecting people to add on to our work and implement it according to their needs.   
</ul>

<b>Sustainability goal #12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns</b>
<ul>
Positive Impact:
Lowering carbon footprint.  One goal we achieved was building our MVP prototype out of reused components.  With a few exceptions all of the components were donated. 
For example, we repurposed a broken 3D printer, using the mechanism that moves the printing nozzle to pump our ambu bag. We used the wires from old machines that were going to be discarded.  Moving forward we plan on continuing to be resourceful for our alpha release. This also allowed us to spend within our means.
</ul>

<b>Sustainability goal #13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts</b>
<ul>
Positive Impact:
Reducing our carbon footprint by re-using old components. Our plan is also to have our product work via a rechargeable power source. 
</ul>
