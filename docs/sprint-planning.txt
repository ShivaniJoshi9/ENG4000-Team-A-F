During pur sprint planning meetings. We will set Sprit Goals and ask ourselves:

-What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
-How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

By the end of the sprint Planning meeting, the Development Team will explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.
