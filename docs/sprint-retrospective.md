# Sprint Retrospective

The retrospective meeting will be a streamlined, decision making process that allows us to
walk through what worked well for the team and what did not during the past or the current
sprint.The main aim of this meeting is to hear out personal opinions and ideas in a
no-judgement zone in order to improve the team efficiency and dynamics.

We suspect this meeting will run an hour long, taking place after the sprint review and before
we plan the next Sprint. Team members will come together and spend 2-3 minutes filling out
sticky notes with their perspective for each section(in total 6 sections,approximately 20
minutes).

Upon populating the sections of the board, the team, guided by the meeting facilitator(could
be any member of the team), will dedicate another 10-20 minutes spotting convergence and
divergence of individual perspectives. This will be followed by a constructive brainstorming
session to address concerns and derive an equitable solution.

Our team developed this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DJoTnoQnha75LZt_Z7ayyB9dgPZQphm0/view?usp=sharing), which explains how plan on running the sprint retrospective meetings. 

Futhermore, we will document our conversations on the Sprint Retrospective Stormboard attached to our (Team AF's)
Microsoft Teams private channel. As seen below:
