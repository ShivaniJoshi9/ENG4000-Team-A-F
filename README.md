### The Scrum Team 

Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional teams- choosing how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.

They consist of a ***Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.***

### The Product Owner
Is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team. Also, is solely responsible for managing the Product Backlog.

***Our team’s Product Owner is Shivani Joshi.***


### The Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum- helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.

***Our team’s Scrum master is Jonathan Blumenfeld.***

### The Development Team
The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable. Their work increments the progress of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.

Our team’s development team includes:
* Areeba Abidi
* Siddharth Bhardwaj
* Jonathan Blumenfeld
* Shivani Joshi
* Priyam Shah
